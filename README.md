## About Performing a Hybrid Search

Hybrid search combines the capabilities of traditional keyword-based search with vector-based similarity search to provide more relevant and contextual results. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex queries that benefit from understanding the semantic meaning behind the text.

## About Performing a Hybrid Search with Reranking
